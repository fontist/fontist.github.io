[![Open in Codeflow](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_codeflow.svg)](https://pr.new/https://github.com/fontist/fontist.github.io)

This site uses [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) as a static site generator. The website is hosted through GitHub Pages. There are sub-sites hosted from other GitHub [@fontist](https://github.com/fontist) repositories such as [fontist/fontist](https://github.com/fontist/fontist) which hosts [fontist.org/fontist](https://fontist.org/fontist/).

üí° Try to keeps this root website about the organization as a whole and redirect or point to other project-specific sub-sites where appropriate.

üìù To create a new blog post you need to 1) create a new `.md` file in the `blog/` folder and 2) add it to the `blog/index.md` index page.

‚Ñπ `docs/` and `software/` are just redirects. They have a bunch of `.../index.md` files with redirects to the appropriate sub-sites.
