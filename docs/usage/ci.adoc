= How to use Fontist in CI systems?

For example, in Github Actions you can create workflow with the following steps:

[source,yaml]
----
- uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: 2.7

- run: gem install fontist

- run: fontist install --accept-all-licenses "arial"
----

It would setup Ruby, install Fontist as a gem (a Ruby library), and install the
Arial font.

== Platform-specific fonts

Some fonts are available only on specific platforms, because of license
restrictions. For example, the Canela font can be installed only on macOS. To
install it, just use an image with a proper OS:

[source,yaml]
----
runs-on: macos-10.15
steps:
  - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
    with:
      ruby-version: 2.7

  - run: gem install fontist

  - run: fontist install --accept-all-licenses "canela"
----

WARNING: Fontist does not allow installing macOS-specific fonts on non-macOS
platforms due to font licensing of those fonts.
