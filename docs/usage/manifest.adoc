= How to install a bundle of fonts at once?

Several fonts can be specified in a file, called "manifest", and installed
together.

First, prepare a file "manifest.yml":

[source,yaml]
----
---
Times New Roman:
Arial:
Courier New:
----

Then run:

[source,sh]
----
fontist manifest-install manifest.yml
----

This command would install or find all 3 fonts, and return its paths.

== How to get paths of installed fonts?

Once you installed fonts via the manifest file, you can get their locations:

[source,sh]
----
fontist manifest-locations manifest.yml
----

The output is in the YAML format:

[source,sh]
----
---
Times New Roman:
  Bold Italic:
    full_name: Times New Roman Bold Italic
    paths:
    - "/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Times New Roman Bold Italic.ttf"
    - "/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/timesbi.ttf"
  Italic:
    full_name: Times New Roman Italic
    paths:
    - "/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Times New Roman Italic.ttf"
    - "/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/timesi.ttf"
----

If one or some of requested fonts are missing, the "3" error code would be
returned, and a message printed:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist manifest-locations manifest.yml
'Roboto Mono' 'Regular' font is missing, please run `fontist install 'Roboto Mono'` to download the font.
$ echo $?
3
