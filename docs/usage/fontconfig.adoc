= How to use Fontconfig with Fontist?

Fontconfig is a software designed to provide fonts to other programs. It is
typically used on Linux, but also available on macOS and Windows. Fontconfig is
used by LibreOffice, GIMP, and many other programs.

It order to find fontist fonts, Fontconfig should be updated to include fontist
paths. It can be done with the `--update-fontconfig` option of `install`:

[source,sh]
----
fontist install --update-fontconfig 'courier prime'
----

Or by calling a special command:

[source,sh]
----
fontist fontconfig update
----

It would create a config in `~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/10-fontist.conf`.

To remove it, please use:

[source,sh]
----
fontist fontconfig remove
----
